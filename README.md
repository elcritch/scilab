# scilab: Scientific Library Code

Beginning the transition to open sourcing this library. 

The most useful program here is the scientific test gui program located in `scilab/graphicaltools/guiprocessor.py`.

I'd like to transition the `guiprocessor` app to the main program in this project, but currently it's not high on my priority list. Because of this, the initial license will be:

[The CRAPL: An academic-strength open source license](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/)

Enjoy :-)
