1. Convert Instron CSV file to MATLAB binary file
	- Tracking Headers: Time, Step, Cycle, Elapsed Cycle, Load, Stress, Disp, Strain
	- Trends Headers: Time, Step, Cycle, Elapsed Cycle, Min/Max Load, Min/Max Stress, Min/Max Disp, Min/Max Strain

+ Load each test, graph all, save json with min/max/avg/std for each step

+ graph fatigue test, take first stage, graph cycles
